\section{Introduction}
Network analysing can be used in various topics, including transportation, biology, chemistry and more. For example, logistics developers need excellent knowledge in network science to reduce the cost and time of transportation networks. Another example can be using network science knowledge to study the interaction and behavior between animals. Food web is a classic example that ecologists are still studying since a hundred years ago.

At 2013, Brandes et al. \cite{brandes_robins_mccranie_wasserman_2013} suggested that "we can view network science as the study of the collection, management, analysis, interpretation and presentation of relational data."
